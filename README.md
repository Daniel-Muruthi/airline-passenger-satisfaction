# ✈️ Airline Passenger Satisfaction Analysis

## Overview

This project delves into the factors influencing airline passenger satisfaction by analyzing a comprehensive dataset of over 129,000 survey responses. Utilizing data science and machine learning techniques, the goal is to uncover key determinants of passenger satisfaction and develop predictive models to assist airlines in enhancing customer experience.

## Objectives

- **Data Exploration**: Conduct thorough exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution and relationships within the data.
- **Feature Engineering**: Identify and create relevant features that contribute to passenger satisfaction.
- **Model Development**: Build and evaluate machine learning models to predict passenger satisfaction levels.
- **Insights Generation**: Derive actionable insights to inform airline service improvements.

## Dataset

The dataset comprises detailed information on airline passengers, including:

- **Demographics**: Gender, Age, Customer Type (Loyal/Disloyal)
- **Travel Details**: Type of Travel (Business/Personal), Class (Economy, Economy Plus, Business), Flight Distance
- **Service Ratings**: Inflight Wi-Fi, Online Booking, Gate Location, Food and Drink, Online Boarding, Seat Comfort, Inflight Entertainment, On-board Service, Leg Room, Baggage Handling, Check-in Service, Inflight Service, Cleanliness
- **Timeliness**: Departure and Arrival Delays
- **Satisfaction**: Overall satisfaction level categorized as 'Satisfied' or 'Neutral/Dissatisfied'

## Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing**

   - Handled missing values and outliers to ensure data quality.
   - Encoded categorical variables for model compatibility.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

   - Visualized distributions and relationships between variables.
   - Identified key factors correlating with passenger satisfaction.

3. **Modeling**

   - Implemented various supervised learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests.
   - Evaluated models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

4. **Feature Importance**
   - Analyzed feature importances to determine the most influential factors on passenger satisfaction.

## Key Findings

- **Service Quality Matters**: Features like Inflight Wi-Fi, Seat Comfort, and Cleanliness significantly impact passenger satisfaction.
- **Timeliness is Crucial**: Departure and arrival delays negatively correlate with satisfaction levels.
- **Customer Loyalty**: Loyal customers tend to report higher satisfaction, emphasizing the importance of customer retention strategies.
- **Travel Class Influence**: Passengers in Business class report higher satisfaction compared to those in Economy or Economy Plus.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
- **Tools**: Jupyter Notebook
